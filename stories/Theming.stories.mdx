# Theming

Pretty much everything is configured to be a CSS variable in Emrooz, so the theme of the calendar can be changed
by overriding CSS variables.

```CSS
:root {
  --em-primary-color: red;
  /* And so on */
}
```

The list of CSS variables used in Emrooz can be found in [here](https://github.com/cafebazaar/emroozjs/blob/master/lib/shared/styles/abstracts/_vars.scss).
